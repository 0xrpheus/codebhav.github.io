<em>\*narrator's voice\*</em>

<p>bhav's a 24 y/o graduate student who likes making <a href="https://github.com/codebhav" target="_blank">cool shit</a> (mostly using sveltekit and tailwindcss).</p>

<p>he often tries to interest you in everything all of the time through his questionable <a href="https://whybhav.substack.com/" target="_blank">writing</a> and what critics refer to as just-good-enough <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reallywhybhav/" target="_blank">photography</a>. he loves all things <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/0rs4afffl5o4avb4ilxbot2ty?si=baeaa50c7a9c417c" target="_blank">music</a>, <a href="https://letterboxd.com/whybhav/" target="_blank">films</a>, and <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/reallywhybhav" target="_blank">chess</a>.

<p>despite the horrors, he still believes the world is worth saving. he is extremely passionate about making technology, education, and healthcare accessible to everyone.</p>

<p>he also has one of those <a href="/assets/docs/Resume.pdf" target="_blank">résumés</a>, if you even care.</p>
