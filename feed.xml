<p>i built the first version of my portfolio, even before i owned this domain, shortly after my first ever web programming class during my undergrad, using plain html, css, and js.</p>

<p>after about a year, i built the second version—a single-page threejs application with a cool 3d render (gltf) of a pc setup. this is, by far, the flashiest project i’ve ever worked on. i learned so much when i was working on it, like the fact that i do not enjoy working with 3d files.</p>

<p>like clockwork, i got bored after a year and built a new one overnight that was much simpler using reactjs. this time, it even had a blog section—but i never published anything, so did it really have a blog section?</p>

<p>it was a really shitty website, probably the worst one of the three so far. but the homepage was a clean bento-grid layout, so i let it hang around for a while, thinking i’d fix all its flaws during christmas.</p>

<p>i tried about four or five variations of this new site, even building them using different frameworks. my use case was pretty simple: i needed a blog site to yap, with a place for people to leave comments if they wish to do so and to post the photos i’ve taken.</p>

<p>at last, i have settled on an extremely simple yet elegant solution: jekyll + github pages. this site is almost entirely markdown-based, and dare i say, <em>i fw it heavy</em>. i really like how clean and simple it looks. i intend to use this space to write about projects i’m working on and also to talk about anything and everything i find interesting.</p>
