Welcome to yet another iteration of my website.

<!-- more -->

I built the first version of my portfolio, even before I owned this domain, shortly after my first web programming class during my undergrad, using plain HTML, CSS, and JS.

After about a year, I built the second version—a single-page ThreeJS application with a cool 3D render (GLTF) of a PC setup. This is, by far, the flashiest project I've ever worked on. I learned so much when I was working on it, like the fact that I do not enjoy working with 3D files.

Like clockwork, I got bored after a year and built a new one overnight that was much simpler using ReactJS. This time, it even had a blog section—but I never published anything, so did it really have a blog section?

It was a really shitty website, probably the worst one of the three so far. But the homepage was a clean bento-grid layout, so I let it hang around for a while, thinking I'd fix all its flaws during Christmas.

I tried about four or five variations of this new site, even building them using different frameworks. My use case was pretty simple: I needed a blog site to yap, with a place for people to leave comments if they wish to do so and to post the photos I've taken.

At last, I have settled on an extremely simple yet elegant solution: Jekyll + GitHub pages. This site is almost entirely markdown-based, and dare I say, _i fw it heavy_. I really like how clean and simple it looks. I intend to use this space to write about projects I'm working on and also to talk about anything and everything I find interesting.
